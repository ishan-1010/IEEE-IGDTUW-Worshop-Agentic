> **Build your first self-correcting AI agent — from scratch, for free, in 1 hour.**

Welcome to the **IEEE IGDTUW Workshop**! Today, you won't just *talk* about AI; you will **build** an autonomous agent that acts as a savage (but helpful) career coach.

Your agent will:
1.  **Analyze** resume bullet points.
2.  **Roast** the weak ones.
3.  **Rewrite** them to be stronger.
4.  **Critique its own work** to make it perfect.
